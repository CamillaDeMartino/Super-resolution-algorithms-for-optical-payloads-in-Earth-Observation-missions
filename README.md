## Super resolution algorithms for optical payloads in Earth Observation missions

### Explanation
Source code and documentation for my master's thesis on super-resolution algorithms for optical payloads in Earth observation missions. Implemented using both spatial and frequency domains, with a focus on curvelet transform application. Part of a NASA-ASI mission to enhance image resolution and quality from Earth observation satellites.

### Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone linkRepository
    ```

2. Run the requirements file to set up the working environment:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Curvelops
Curvelops is a Python wrapper for CurveLab's 2D and 3D curvelet transforms. It uses the PyLops design framework to provide forward and inverse curvelet transforms as matrix-free linear operations. If you are still confused, take a look at some examples below or visit the PyLops website!

If you encounter issues via the requirements.txt file, follow the installation guide used for the Curvelops library available here:
